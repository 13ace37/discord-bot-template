## Basic Information

This repo houses my discord.js bot template. I'll warn you that my coding style is kinda weird and I change it pretty often. So this might not match your style. 

The bot can be started by using `node src/index.js {token}` - the token in the config file will overwrite the command line argument!

## Requirements 

<kbd><img src="./.img/node.png" height="20"/></kbd> **NodeJS Version:** ^15.5.0+<br/>
<kbd><img src="https://discord.js.org/static/logo-square.png" height="20"/></kbd> **Discord.js Version:** ^12.5.1+

## Folder Hirachy

| folder/file  | purpose | description |
| -------------  | ------------- | ------------- |
| `config.js` | default config dir | can be changed in the `src/index.js` file |
| `src/index.js` | main bot file | should not be changed |
| `src/Bot/*` | main source | all new files can be added in the sub folders |
| `src/Bot/Commands/*` | command files | new commands will be autoloaded by name |
| `src/Bot/commandHandler.js` | command handle | should not be changed ~ _depends on the usage of the bot_ |
| `src/Bot/index.js` | init bot source | should be changed to fit your needs |

You can find a `index.js` in any of the subfolders of the `src` folder. These are meant for the main code of the given section.

### Logging

I provide a custom logger using `this.Client.Logger`. This class holds 3 functions and they represent 3 log "levels": `log, warn, err`.
The log files are created in the root folder under `/logs` and are named `out-{date}.log` and `err-{date}.log`. The "err" one hold the warnings and errors and the rest goes to the "out" one.


Example:

```js

// The logID is saved internally and get increased for each log starting at 1.
this.Client.Logger.log("Connected to the server!"); // expected output: LOG  ~ [DATE] [TIME] #1: Connected to the server! 
this.Client.Logger.log("Connected to the server!"); // expected output: LOG  ~ [DATE] [TIME] #2: Connected to the server!
this.Client.Logger.log("Connected to the server!", 773); // expected output: LOG  ~ [DATE] [TIME] #773: Connected to the server!  

// The logID only effects the .log() function the .warn() and .error() function print 0 or the one you provide.
this.Client.Logger.warn("Connection not stable!"); // expected output: WARN ~ [DATE] [TIME] #0: Connection not stable!
this.Client.Logger.warn("Connection not stable!", 34); // expected output: WARN ~ [DATE] [TIME] #34: Connection not stable!

// The logID only effects the .log() function the .warn() and .error() function print 0 or the one you provide
this.Client.Logger.error("Not connected to the server!"); // expected output: ERR  ~ [DATE] [TIME] #0: Not connected to the server!
this.Client.Logger.error("Not connected to the server!", 21); // expected output: ERR  ~ [DATE] [TIME] #21: Not connected to the server! 

```

### Commands

The command name is defined by the filename. If you want a `!hello` command, you'll need to create a file named `hello.js` in the `src/Bot/Commands/` folder.

Template:


```js
let Command = require("."); //gets the default Command class

module.exports = class extends Command {
	// must be defined - returns a string with the description of the command function
	// can also return false - gets replaced with N/A
	getInfo() { 
		return "says hello and thanks the user";
	}
	// must be defined - runs if users types the command
	/* expected result: 
		Bot: Hello I'm a bot.
		Bot: @User, thanks for using this bot.
	*/
	run() {
		this.send("Hello I'm a bot.");
		this.reply("thanks for using this bot.");
	}
}
```

Default functions/variables:

```js
this.message 		// message object returned from onMessage event
this.Client 		// discord bot client object


this.send(message)	// sends a normal message in the channel where the command got executed

// replies to the user with a tag in the channel where the command got executed
// Format: @user, {message}
this.reply(message)
```

## Code Style

- The code is heavily object-based without any non-object variables.
- All temporary created "variables" are defined in the current `this` object of the class and deleted using `delete this.[var]` after they were used.
- The first character of "top-level" objects or variables are uppercase and the rest is lower- & camelcase. 
Code outside a function is to be avoided.
