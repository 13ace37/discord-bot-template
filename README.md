## Basic Information

This repo houses my discord.js bot template. I'll warn you that my coding style is kinda weird and I change it pretty often. So this might not match your style. 

## Requirements 

<kbd><img src="./.img/node.png" height="20"/></kbd> **NodeJS Version:** ^15.5.0+<br/>
<kbd><img src="https://discord.js.org/static/logo-square.png" height="20"/></kbd> **Discord.js Version:** ^12.5.1+

## Folder Hirachy

| folder/file  | purpose | description |
| -------------  | ------------- | ------------- |
| `config.js` | default config dir | can be changed in the `src/index.js` file |
| `src/index.js` | main bot file | should not be changed |
| `src/Bot/*` | main source | all new files can be added in the sub folders |
| `src/Bot/Commands/*` | command files | new commands will be autoloaded by name |
| `src/Bot/commandHandler.js` | command handle | should not be changed ~ _depends on the usage of the bot_ |
| `src/Bot/index.js` | init bot source | should be changed to fit your needs |

You can find a `index.js` in any of the subfolders of the `src` folder. These are meant for the main code of the given section.

## Code Style

- The code is heavily object-based without any non-object variables.
- All temporary created "variables" are defined in the current `this` object of the class and deleted using `delete this.[var]` after they were used.
- The first character of "top-level" objects or variables are uppercase and the rest is lower- & camelcase. 
Code outside a function is to be avoided.
